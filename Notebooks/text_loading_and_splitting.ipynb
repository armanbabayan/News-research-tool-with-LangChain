    "> To effectively handle input text within the token limits of Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to break down the text into smaller chunks to avoid exceeding the token limit. In addition to manual splitting, there are two more efficient methods for text segmentation provided by LangChain. The first method involves *character splitting*, which allows you to segment the data based on a specified character. The second method is *recursive splitting*, which provides the flexibility to segment the given text using multiple characters. This approach can be particularly valuable when dealing with extensive texts, as a single delimiter may not produce the desired results."
